# FullStory and Github Integration Challenge.
The objective of this challenge was to use FullStory and github api's to create a useful or interesting application.

This application uses the data export json file from the FullStory dashboard. When uploaded the program will search to see if the import has any errors reported. If there are errors it creates an issue in github for the project.

A operational version of this program can be found here:

To install clone the repo.

Run npm install.

Run node serve.js

Open local host and upload a json file.

Specifically use one of the json files fond in the uploads folder of the repo.
